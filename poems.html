    <h2> I'm Nobody! Who are you?</h2>
    <p> Emily Dickinson</p>
    <p>
        I’m Nobody! Who are you? <br>
        Are you – Nobody – too?<br>
        Then there’s a pair of us!<br>
        Don’t tell! they’d advertise – you know!<br><br>

        How dreary – to be – Somebody!<br>
        How public – like a Frog –<br>
        To tell one’s name – the livelong June –<br>
        To an admiring Bog!<br>
    </p>
    <p> Interpretation:</p>
    <p> This poem speaks to the dangers of publicity</p>
    <p> When you're no one, there are no expectations, no attention, no one to please, less pressure to perform, freedom to create</p>


    <h2> Wish you were here</h2>
    <p> Pink Floyd</p>
    <p> Static radio: </p>
    <p> And disciplinary remains mercifully <br>
        Yes, and um, not with you, Derek, this star nonsense?<br>
        Yes, yes<br>
        No, it isn't<br>
        Yeah, I am sure of it<br><br>
        
        So, so you think you can tell<br>
        Heaven from hell? Blue skies from pain?<br>
        Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?<br>
        A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?<br> <br>
        
        Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?<br>
        Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?<br>
        Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange<br>
        A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?<br><br>
        How I wish, how I wish you were here<br>
        We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl, year after year<br>
        Runnin' over the same old ground, what have we found?<br>
        The same old fears, wish you were here</p>
    <p>**Not a "poem" but still poetic</p>
