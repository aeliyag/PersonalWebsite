    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <p> Theres Deep and Shallow Work...Deep work requires focus and creates learning and progress, Shallow work distracts</p>
    <p> Theres so much noise in the world. Deep Work requires you to ignore this noise</p>
    <p> You want to be part of one of the three: Being the best at a specalization, being efficeint with working with technology (ex. ChatGpt), have capital</p>
    <p> High-Quality work produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus) </p>
    <p> August 6th - Am noticing the effect of notifications and messages and its intensity with distrupting flow. Plan right now to fix this is to keep focus and notifications off but get into a habit of checking proper messaging at given times of the day. By removing notication I should be removing the immediate need or desire to repsond to these messages helping me mainting my deep work.</p>
