      <h1> Week of August 18-24th</h1>
      <p><b>August 23rd</b></p>
      <p> Met with Balaji Srinivasan, senior engineer. I learned about his current work at LinkedIn with creating coding agents to help automate testing and creating tools for the linked in developers which I found really interested and revelant especially with the new era of vibe coding, tools that properly incorporate AI technologies will help 
        make development and efficiency much faster.
